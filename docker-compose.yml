# LogviewR - Docker Compose (Production)
# ===========================================
#
# Docker Compose configuration for PRODUCTION
# 
# Usage:
#   docker-compose up -d
#   docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d  # Update and restart
#
# Environment variables:
#   DASHBOARD_PORT - Dashboard port (default: 7500)
#   JWT_SECRET     - JWT secret for authentication (REQUIRED - use .env file)
#   PUBLIC_URL     - Public URL if using reverse proxy (optional)
#
# IMPORTANT: Create a .env file with JWT_SECRET before starting:
#   JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
#   echo "JWT_SECRET=$JWT_SECRET" > .env

    environment:
      # 🔐 SECRET OBLIGATOIRE - JWT secret for authentication
      # ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY: Never use default secret in production!
      # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
      # Store in .env file: JWT_SECRET=votre_secret_genere
      JWT_SECRET: ${JWT_SECRET}

      # Dashboard port mapping (host port → container port 3000)
      # This is the port exposed on the host machine
      # Must match the port in the "ports" section above
      DASHBOARD_PORT: ${DASHBOARD_PORT:-7500}
      
      # Host machine IP (for banner and URLs) - RECOMMENDED in Docker
      # Without this, the banner shows the Docker gateway IP (e.g. 192.168.48.1), not your host IP.
      # Set in .env to your machine's LAN IP so you see the correct URL to open in the browser.
      # Example: HOST_IP=192.168.32.150
      HOST_IP: ${HOST_IP:-}

      # Configuration file path (optional external config file)
      CONFIG_FILE_PATH: ${CONFIG_FILE_PATH:-/app/config/logviewr.conf}

      # Host metrics access (read-only mount of host filesystem)
      # Used to read hostname, disk usage, and system info from the host
      HOST_ROOT_PATH: ${HOST_ROOT_PATH:-/host}

      # PUBLIC_URL (only if using reverse proxy like nginx)
      # Uncomment and set if accessing via domain name instead of IP:port
      # PUBLIC_URL: https://dashboard.example.com

    # Add node user to adm group (GID 4) to read log files owned by root:adm
    # This allows reading files like auth.log, cron.log, daemon.log, etc.
    # The GID 4 is standard for adm group on Debian/Ubuntu systems
    # If your system uses a different GID for adm, set ADM_GID in .env file
    group_add:
      - "${ADM_GID:-4}"  # Default GID 4 for adm group

    volumes:
      # Persistent storage for:
      # - SQLite database (dashboard.db)
      # - Application configuration
      - ./data:/app/data
      # Mount host filesystem (read-only) to access real host metrics
      # This allows the app to read hostname, disk usage, and other system info from the host
      # NOTE: This mount creates /host directory and mounts everything including /var/log
      - /:/host:ro
      # Mount host /proc and /sys separately for better compatibility
      # These are used to read CPU, memory, network stats, and hostname
      - /proc:/host/proc:ro
      - /sys:/host/sys:ro
      # Create symlink /host/logs -> /host/var/log for backward compatibility
      # The plugin expects /host/logs but /host/var/log is already available via /:/host:ro
      # This is done via entrypoint script to avoid Docker mount issues
      # 
      # ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT mount /var/log:/host/logs:ro here!
      # It causes "read-only file system" errors. Use the symlink created by entrypoint instead.
      #
      # Optional: Mount specific log directories for direct access
      # Uncomment if you want plugins to access logs directly without /host/ prefix:
      # - /var/log/apache2:/var/log/apache2:ro    # Apache logs (accessible at /var/log/apache2)
      # - /var/log/nginx:/var/log/nginx:ro        # Nginx logs (accessible at /var/log/nginx)
      # - /var/log/npm:/var/log/npm:ro            # NPM logs (accessible at /var/log/npm)
      # Note: Without these mounts, plugins must use /host/var/log/... paths in configuration
      #
      # NPM (Nginx Proxy Manager) custom data path: NO need to add a volume.
      # The mount "/: /host:ro" already exposes the whole host. In the plugin config,
      # use the path AS ON THE HOST, e.g. /home/docker/nginx_proxy/data/logs —
      # the app resolves it to /host/home/docker/nginx_proxy/data/logs inside the container.

    # Health check: verify container is responding to API requests
    # Uses wget (available in Alpine base image) to check /api/health endpoint
